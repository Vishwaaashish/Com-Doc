1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have a compatible web browser installed (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
   - Obtain valid login credentials for the web application (username and password).

2. **Access the Web Application:**
   - Open your chosen web browser.

3. **Navigate to the Login Page:**
   - In the browser's address bar, type the URL of the web application's login page (e.g., www.example.com/login) and press Enter.
   - The login page of the web application should load.

4. **Perform Successful Login:**
   - Enter your valid username and password in the appropriate fields on the login page.
   - Click on the "Login" or "Sign In" button.
   - Verify that you are successfully redirected to the home/dashboard page of the application.
   - Check for any user-specific information or elements that indicate a successful login (e.g., user profile picture, username displayed).

5. **Perform Invalid Username Login Attempt:**
   - Go back to the login page if you're not already there.
   - Enter an invalid username in the "Username" field and a valid password in the "Password" field.
   - Click on the "Login" or "Sign In" button.
   - Observe the error message that is displayed.
   - Compare the displayed error message with the expected error message mentioned in the "Expected Result" section of the bug report.
   - Ensure that the error message accurately reflects the problem, which should be related to the incorrect username.

6. **Perform Missing Username Login Attempt:**
   - Go back to the login page if you're not already there.
   - Leave the "Username" field empty and enter your valid password in the "Password" field.
   - Click on the "Login" or "Sign In" button.
   - Observe the error message that is displayed.
   - Compare the displayed error message with the expected error message mentioned in the "Expected Result" section of the bug report.
   - Ensure that the error message accurately reflects the problem, which should indicate that the "Username" field is required.

7. **Perform Missing Password Login Attempt:**

8. **Clean Up:**
   - Log out from the application if you are still logged in.
   - Close the web browser.

9. **Report Findings:**
   - If any discrepancies or issues are found during the tests, document them along with the steps you followed and the observed outcomes.
   - If you encounter the bug related to the incorrect error message, provide the details mentioned in the bug report for reporting to the development team.

Running these tests will help you verify the functionality of the login page and identify any potential issues.
